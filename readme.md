# Guess The Country Game

The game is very simple. It is a country guesser where you can find two modes:

1. Guess by country
2. Or guess by region

When an attempt is completed its information is displayed in a table where the last 6 attempts are listed. 
These attempts are stored in the localStorage.

## Motivation

While studying Sass pre-processor I decided to make a simple game to practice the basics that I learned from it.
This helped me a lot of understanding how Sass works in a simple way.
